# Google Calendar Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased approach for integrating Google Calendar with our BandDb application. The integration will follow the "Band Admin OAuth" approach, where a band administrator connects their Google account to create and manage a shared calendar for the band.

## Phase 1: Authentication Setup (1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Establish secure OAuth connection between BandDb and Google Calendar.

### Tasks:
1. Register application in Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Google Calendar API
   - Configure OAuth consent screen (requesting only necessary calendar scopes)
   - Generate OAuth client ID and secret

2. Implement OAuth flow in Phoenix
   - Create OAuth controller with callback endpoint
   - Implement secure token storage in database
   - Handle token refresh logic

3. Create admin settings interface
   - Add "Connect to Google Calendar" button in admin panel
   - Provide clear permissions explanation
   - Show connection status and disconnect option

### Validation Criteria:
- Admin can successfully authenticate with Google
- OAuth tokens are securely stored and refreshed when needed
- Connection status is accurately displayed in the admin UI

## Phase 2: Basic Calendar Operations (1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Create and manage a band-specific calendar.

### Tasks:
1. Create Google Calendar API client module
   - Implement calendar creation function
   - Implement calendar retrieval/listing function
   - Add calendar metadata operations (update, delete)

2. Build calendar management interface
   - Show existing calendars
   - Allow admin to create a new "[Band Name] Rehearsals & Shows" calendar
   - Provide calendar customization options (color, description)

3. Implement calendar viewing within app
   - Display simple monthly/weekly calendar view
   - Show basic event information

### Validation Criteria:
- Admin can create and view a band calendar
- Calendar appears in both BandDb and Google Calendar
- Basic calendar operations function correctly

## Phase 3: Event Integration (2-3 weeks)
**Goal:** Automatically sync rehearsal plans and set lists with calendar events.

### Tasks:
1. Extend rehearsal plan functionality
   - Add calendar event creation when saving rehearsal plans
   - Include relevant details (date, duration, location, link back to plan)
   - Handle updates and deletions

2. Extend set list functionality
   - Add performance event creation when saving set lists
   - Include performance details (venue, time, link back to set list)
   - Handle updates and deletions

3. Implement bidirectional linking
   - Create deep links from calendar events to BandDb resources
   - Show calendar event status in rehearsal/set list views
   - Sync changes in either direction

### Validation Criteria:
- Creating rehearsals automatically creates calendar events
- Creating set lists for performances adds show events to calendar
- Updates in app are reflected in calendar and vice versa
- Links between resources work correctly

## Phase 4: Sharing & Notifications (1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Ensure all band members have access to the calendar and receive appropriate notifications.

### Tasks:
1. Implement calendar sharing
   - Auto-generate sharing settings for band members
   - Create one-click sharing options for admin
   - Provide different permission levels (view vs. edit)

2. Add notification system
   - Send email notifications for new calendar events
   - Create in-app notifications for upcoming rehearsals/shows
   - Allow users to set notification preferences

3. Build sharing management UI
   - Show current sharing status
   - Allow admin to adjust permissions
   - Provide sharing links/codes

### Validation Criteria:
- All band members can access the calendar
- Notifications are delivered appropriately
- Sharing permissions work as expected

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features (2+ weeks)
**Goal:** Add advanced calendar features to improve scheduling efficiency.

### Tasks:
1. Implement availability checking
   - Add conflict detection when scheduling new events
   - Create visual indicators for potential scheduling conflicts
   - Allow band members to mark unavailable times

2. Add recurring event support
   - Support for regular rehearsal schedules
   - Handle exceptions to recurring events
   - Sync recurring events with Google Calendar

3. Create calendar insights
   - Track rehearsal frequency and duration
   - Show upcoming performance preparation timelines
   - Highlight scheduling patterns and conflicts

### Validation Criteria:
- System helps avoid scheduling conflicts
- Recurring events work correctly
- Insights provide valuable scheduling information

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Store OAuth tokens securely (encrypted at rest)
- Implement proper token refresh logic
- Use minimal permissions scopes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API rate limits
- Recovery from sync failures
- Clear error messages for users

### Performance
- Batch API operations where possible
- Asynchronous updates for non-critical operations
- Smart caching to reduce API calls

## Future Extensions
- Mobile push notifications
- Integration with other calendar providers
- Advanced availability preferences (preferred days/times)
- Multi-calendar support for different band activities
