# Deployment Guidelines

## Platform
- Application deployed to fly.io using the free tier
- All deployments managed through fly.io CLI
- Production secrets set using fly secrets
- Prioritize free tier usage for as long as possible

## Environment Configuration
- Use runtime.exs for environment-specific settings
- Set production database URL through fly.io secrets
- Configure release settings appropriately for fly.io
- Optimize for resource efficiency to stay within free limits

## Release Process
- Verify all tests pass before deployment
- Run database migrations as part of release process
- Monitor deployment logs for errors
- Ensure releases are optimized for minimal resource consumption

## Resource Optimization
- Use minimal VM configurations that fit within free tier limits
- Optimize application for low memory usage
- Implement efficient database queries to minimize resource consumption
- Monitor resource usage to stay within free tier limits
- Do not enable any paid features without explicit approval

## Scaling
- Configure appropriate fly.io machine sizes based on workload
- Utilize fly.io regions for optimal latency
- Set appropriate memory/CPU constraints
