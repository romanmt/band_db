# Development Guidelines

## Core Principles
- State managed in memory, persisted only for restarts/resilience
- Keep state management, business logic, and persistence code separate
- All migrations must have both up and down functions
- Develop in small, testable steps
- Use conventional commit messages
- Write tests for all new functionality

## Coding Conventions
- snake_case for variables and functions
- PascalCase for modules
- Use @moduledoc and @doc for documentation
- Small, focused functions with single responsibility
- Use pattern matching and guards effectively
- Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions
- Fix all compiler warnings before committing
