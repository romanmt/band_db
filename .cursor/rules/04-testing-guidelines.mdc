# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Principles
- One concept per test
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names explaining expected behavior
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests
- Use TDD approach when possible

## Testing Best Practices
- Test public interfaces, not implementation details
- Keep assertions focused and specific
- Create helpers/factories for common test setup
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Maintain test code with same care as production code
- Avoid excessive mocking that obscures behavior
