# Date and Time Handling

## Data Types
- Use Elixir's built-in `Date`, `Time`, and `DateTime` structs
- Avoid string representations except at API boundaries

## Time Zone Handling
- All `DateTime` structs must include explicit time zone information
- Use "America/New_York" as the default time zone
- Preserve original timezone when working with external services
- Create datetimes in their intended timezone

## Data Exchange
- Use ISO 8601 format with timezone information
- Parse timestamps using `DateTime.from_iso8601/1`
- Include explicit timezone information in all exchanges

## Event Modeling
- Support all-day events (date only) and time-specific events
- For all-day events, store only the `date` field
- For time-specific events, store `date`, `start_time`, and `end_time` with timezone
- All-day events in Google Calendar should end on following day (start date + 1)
