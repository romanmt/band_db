#+TITLE: Google Calendar Integration Plan
#+AUTHOR: BandDb Team
#+DATE: 

* Overview
This document outlines the phased approach for integrating Google Calendar with our BandDb application. The integration will follow the "Band Admin OAuth" approach, where a band administrator connects their Google account to create and manage a shared calendar for the band.

* Phase 1: Authentication Setup [1-2 weeks]
:PROPERTIES:
:GOAL: Establish secure OAuth connection between BandDb and Google Calendar
:END:

** Tasks
*** Register application in Google Cloud Console
- [X] Create a new project
- [X] Enable Google Calendar API
- [X] Configure OAuth consent screen (requesting only necessary calendar scopes)
- [X] Generate OAuth client ID and secret

*** Implement OAuth flow in Phoenix
- [X] Create OAuth controller with callback endpoint
- [X] Implement secure token storage in database
- [X] Handle token refresh logic

*** Create admin settings interface
- [X] Add "Connect to Google Calendar" button in admin panel
- [X] Provide clear permissions explanation
- [X] Show connection status and disconnect option

** Validation Criteria
- [X] Admin can successfully authenticate with Google
- [X] OAuth tokens are securely stored and refreshed when needed
- [X] Connection status is accurately displayed in the admin UI

* Phase 2: Basic Calendar Operations [1-2 weeks]
:PROPERTIES:
:GOAL: Create and manage a band-specific calendar
:END:

** Tasks
*** Create Google Calendar API client module
- [X] Implement calendar creation function
- [X] Implement calendar retrieval/listing function
- [X] Add calendar metadata operations (update, delete)

*** Build calendar management interface
- [X] Show existing calendars
- [X] Allow admin to create a new "[Band Name] Rehearsals & Shows" calendar
- [X] Provide calendar customization options (color, description)

*** Implement calendar viewing within app
- [X] Display simple monthly/weekly calendar view
- [X] Show basic event information

** Validation Criteria
- [X] Admin can create and view a band calendar
- [X] Calendar appears in both BandDb and Google Calendar
- [X] Basic calendar operations function correctly

* Phase 3: Event Integration [2-3 weeks]
:PROPERTIES:
:GOAL: Automatically sync rehearsal plans and set lists with calendar events
:END:

** Tasks
*** Extend rehearsal plan functionality
- [X] Add calendar event creation when saving rehearsal plans
- [X] Include relevant details (date, duration, location, link back to plan)
- [X] Handle updates and deletions

*** Extend set list functionality
- [X] Add performance event creation when saving set lists
- [X] Include performance details (venue, time, link back to set list)
- [ ] Handle updates and deletions

*** Implement bidirectional linking
- [X] Create deep links from calendar events to BandDb resources
- [X] Show calendar event status in rehearsal/set list views
- [ ] Sync changes in either direction

** Validation Criteria
- [X] Creating rehearsals automatically creates calendar events
- [X] Creating set lists for performances adds show events to calendar
- [ ] Updates in app are reflected in calendar and vice versa
- [X] Links between resources work correctly

* Phase 4: Sharing & Notifications [1-2 weeks]
:PROPERTIES:
:GOAL: Ensure all band members have access to the calendar and receive appropriate notifications
:END:

** Tasks
*** Implement calendar sharing
- [X] Auto-generate sharing settings for band members
- [X] Create one-click sharing options for admin
- [X] Provide different permission levels (view vs. edit)

*** Add notification system
- [ ] Send email notifications for new calendar events
- [ ] Create in-app notifications for upcoming rehearsals/shows
- [ ] Allow users to set notification preferences

*** Build sharing management UI
- [X] Show current sharing status
- [X] Allow admin to adjust permissions
- [X] Provide sharing links/codes

** Validation Criteria
- [X] All band members can access the calendar
- [ ] Notifications are delivered appropriately
- [X] Sharing permissions work as expected

* Phase 5: Enhanced Features [2+ weeks]
:PROPERTIES:
:GOAL: Add advanced calendar features to improve scheduling efficiency
:END:

** Tasks
*** Implement availability checking
- [ ] Add conflict detection when scheduling new events
- [ ] Create visual indicators for potential scheduling conflicts
- [ ] Allow band members to mark unavailable times

*** Add recurring event support
- [ ] Support for regular rehearsal schedules
- [ ] Handle exceptions to recurring events
- [ ] Sync recurring events with Google Calendar

*** Create calendar insights
- [ ] Track rehearsal frequency and duration
- [ ] Show upcoming performance preparation timelines
- [ ] Highlight scheduling patterns and conflicts

** Validation Criteria
- [ ] System helps avoid scheduling conflicts
- [ ] Recurring events work correctly
- [ ] Insights provide valuable scheduling information

* Technical Considerations
** Security
- [X] Store OAuth tokens securely (encrypted at rest)
- [X] Implement proper token refresh logic
- [X] Use minimal permissions scopes

** Error Handling
- [X] Graceful handling of API rate limits
- [ ] Recovery from sync failures
- [X] Clear error messages for users

** Performance
- [ ] Batch API operations where possible
- [ ] Asynchronous updates for non-critical operations
- [ ] Smart caching to reduce API calls

* Future Extensions
- [ ] Mobile push notifications
- [ ] Integration with other calendar providers
- [ ] Advanced availability preferences (preferred days/times)
- [ ] Multi-calendar support for different band activities
